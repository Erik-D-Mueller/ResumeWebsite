I studied Mechanical Engineering at the Ohio State University but ultimately decided that I like being a developer better. I am a thinker, developer, and a problem solver.
The world is not a net-sum zero game. We're all better off if we work together, which is the basis for everything that I do.  Iâ€™ve had a diverse career that has revolved around
entrepreneurship and technology.  I enjoy thinking outside of the box and finding unique solutions to problems.  I have coded practical solutions to my day to day challenges
my entire life.  I just graduated from a 14 week full-stack web-development coding boot camp and am looking for a role where I can ultimately make a difference.
